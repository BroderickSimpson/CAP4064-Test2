        <title>The Flavor and Texture</title>
        <p>Stop into any our ice cream parlor or peak inside the case at the supermarket, 
            and you will witness the expansive array of flavors, from traditional vanilla  and 
            coffee ice creams to somewhat unusual flavors such as sweet basil and sweet  
            potato. But when it comes to gelato, the flavor profile is much more narrow. 
            There are a few classics you'll find in gelato form—vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut,   
            and stracciatella (vanilla with crunchy chocolate pieces), as well as pistachio,  
            tiramisu, and a variety of fruit flavors—but not necessarily the type of 
            combinations   you see in the ice cream aisle. </p>

            <p>The differences in both treats' compositions and the way they are stored affect 
                the  way they taste and feel in your mouth. Fat coats the tongue, creating a layer 
                between  the taste buds and the food you are eating, and colder food numbs the 
                tongue a bit, making it more difficult to actually taste the food. Since gelato has 
                less fat and  is warmer than ice cream, the flavors come through more and are 
                more intense. These factors also make for a smoother consistency whereas ice 
                cream has more of a  fine crystal texture. </p>
